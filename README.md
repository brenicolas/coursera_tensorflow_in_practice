This repository regroups the code resources of the Coursera online specialization Deep Learning dispensed by the team of deeplearning.ai (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice/). 

Please find below the link of the certification that shows the quality of the code in the files: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/ET84W47R5EPS. 

If you are stuck at some points for this course I deeply recommend you to use the resources of the forums available on the Coursera platform. Most of the time you are not the first to face some difficulties.
